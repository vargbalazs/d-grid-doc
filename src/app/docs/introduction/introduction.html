<h1>DataGrid aka DGrid - the new grid library out there</h1>
<h2>General purpose</h2>
<p>
  This grid library was born in order to have a performant grid library, which
  <b>don't uses zone.js</b>, <b>uses OnPush change detection</b> and <b>uses signals</b> internally
  and also externally for it's inputs (if it makes sense). The grid library was
  <b>written in Angular</b> for only Angular.
</p>
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>As for now, the library uses the following dependencies:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>uuid:</b> for generating unique ids for columns and rows</li>
</ul>
<h2>Internal structure</h2>
<p>
  The grid uses the <b>modern css grid layout with divs</b> instead of classic table elements like
  &lt;th&gt;, &lt;tr&gt; and &lt;td&gt;. Only the <b>main semantic elements</b> (header, body,
  footer) are <b>real Angular components</b> in order to minimize change detection overhead and have
  better performance.
</p>
<h2>Main layout structure</h2>
<p>The main layout structure looks like this:</p>
<code-block [code]="gridStructureHtml" language="html" [showLineNumbers]="true"></code-block>
