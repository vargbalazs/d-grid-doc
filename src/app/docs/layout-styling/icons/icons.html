<h1>Icons</h1>
<p>
  As per default the grid uses build-in <b>svg</b> icons. But if you want to use f. e. font class
  icons, you have to inject the <b><code>DGridIconService</code></b> service in your app and call
  the <b><code>registerFontClass</code></b> method like this:
</p>
<code-block [code]="registerFontClass" language="typescript" [showLineNumbers]="true"></code-block>
<p>
  This assumes of course, that you provided the needed css for your font icons in one of the known
  ways.
