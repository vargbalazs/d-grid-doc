<h1>Grid layout</h1>
<p>
  As stated in the <a routerLink="/docs/introduction">Introduction</a> section, the grid is composed
  of a <b>header</b>, a <b>body</b> and a <b>footer</b>.
</p>
<p>
  As per default, the header is sticked to the top. But you will experience this only, if the height
  of the grid is explicitly set. For your convenience this will be logged also in the console window
  of the dev tools:
</p>
<img src="assets/images/sticky-header-warning.png" alt="Logo" />
<p>
  If you want to change that, you can assign to the <b><code>sticky</code></b> input property of the
  grid a <b><code>DGridSticky</code></b> object. The definition looks like this:
</p>
<code-block [code]="sticky" language="typescript" [showLineNumbers]="true"></code-block>
<p>
  As you see, the header is sticky by default. And you don't have to specify both, if you want to
  change only one of them.
</p>
