<h1>Grid styles</h1>
<p>Each grid has it's own unique id, which is used to generate a root class, f. e.:</p>
<code-block [code]="rootClass" language="html" [showLineNumbers]="true"></code-block>
<p>
  This means, that if there is a need, you can style your grids differently (f. e. if there are
  multiple grids on the same page).
</p>
<p>
  Each grid has also a <b><code>style</code></b> tag, which has an <b><code>id</code></b> attribute
  holding the id of the grid, f. e.:
</p>
<code-block [code]="style" language="html" [showLineNumbers]="true"></code-block>
<p>
  This <b><code>style</code></b> tag is holding different css variables. Some of them are for
  internal use and some of them are meant for theming.
